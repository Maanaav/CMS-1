# CMS
CMS (Canteen Management System) is a console-based application that enhances the capabilities of the normal College Canteens.
Our application provides with the basic ordering functionality wherein a student can order the food he wants, which will be displayed to the Canteen Vendor, while setting the time at which he wants. This way he can skip the queue and enjoy the break with his luscious meal!

Our application aims to provide the feature of coupons which an individual can gain if he/she has more than 200 points, making him eligible for coupons on the next transaction he/she does!

Our application also provides the functionality of offline payment wherein the Vendor will retrieve the User's Details via the SAP-ID and the idea is to send an e-reciept thus saving paper! Cool right, we know!
